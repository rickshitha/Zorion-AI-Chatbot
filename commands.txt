The **'U'** you see next to your files in the **VS Code Explorer** comes from **Git** and stands for **"Untracked"**. This means that the files have not yet been added to the Git repository — Git is aware of them, but they are not being tracked for changes.

### Here's how to fix it:

If you want Git to start tracking those files, do the following:

1. **Stage the files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the files**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add initial backend and frontend files"
   ```

After this, the **'U'** will disappear and change depending on the file's status (`M` for modified, etc.).

Let me know if you want to ignore any files (like `.env`) — I can help you update your `.gitignore`.
